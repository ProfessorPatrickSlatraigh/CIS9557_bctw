        "\n",
        "As a general rule, you should never start creating analytical or machine learning models until you have examined the data and understand the relationships. Otherwise, you risk wasting your time creating models blindly.\n",

        "Visualization is also a powerful tool for presentation of results and for determining sources of problems with analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concepts of exploring and analyzing a data set visually was pioneered by John Tukey in the 1960s and 1970s. Tukey consolidated his many ideas on data exploration into a book in the late 1970s, *John Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977, Addison-Westley*.\n",

        "- Explore complex data sets, using visualization to develop understanding of the inherent relationships.\n",
        "- Use different chart types to create multiple views of data to highlight different aspects of the inherent relationships.\n",
